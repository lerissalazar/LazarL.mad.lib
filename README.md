madlib
the computer will ask the user to input 9 nouns, the computer will then take those nouns and turn them into a sentence.
peer reviewed by- Caroline Hana- The madlib worked great, I wasn't able to break the play again loop so the validation was correct, I also thought the story was funny and creative, maybe add a little more next time, but overall very good job!
